## Operating mode

- Using a Yu-Gi-Oh! API to collect card informations. (API can be found at https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/)
- Displaying all images of the card versions existing in the API.

## Known bugs

- When keeping "enter" pressed for a long time in the text input and then releasing it it displays multiple cards at the same time.

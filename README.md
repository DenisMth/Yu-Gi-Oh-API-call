# Async

https://denismth.github.io/async/

## Description

I started the project by creating an HTML form with basic CSS and then I looked through the Yu-Gi-Oh! API to get all the image sources to display them on my page.

I had some difficulties to loop through the images array in the API, but I managed to get them all and the website displays all the versions of the same card when requested.

## Instructions 

Write the exact name of a Yu-Gi-Oh! card and it displays all the existing versions of this card or you can simply submit and it will display a random card of the Database.

## Operating mode

- Created an HTML form to get a card name to search through an API.
- Using a Yu-Gi-Oh! API to collect card informations. (API can be found at https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/)
- Displaying all images of the card versions existing in the API.

## Known bugs

- When keeping "enter" pressed for a long time in the text input and then releasing it it displays multiple cards at the same time.
